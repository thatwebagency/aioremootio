    Connection options to be used by the client (``aioremootio.RemootioClient``) to connect to the device.

    device. The host name can be one as defined by RFC-1123
    (https://web.archive.org/web/20211118030256/https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1123/#page-13).

    The API Secret Key (``api_secret_key``) and the API Auth Key (``api_auth_key``) are needed to authenticate the
    client by the device. To get this information for the device, you must enable the API on the device. For more
    information please consult the Remootio Websocket API documentation at
    https://github.com/remootio/remootio-api-documentation.

    The flag ``connect_automatically`` controls whether the client should establish a connection to the device during
    its initialization or not. The initialization will be automatically done right after its construction.
